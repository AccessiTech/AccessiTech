# **WCAG Guideline 2.5.6: Concurrent Input Mechanisms Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes letting users switch between input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.) as needed.

## **Guideline 2.5: Input Modalities**

Guideline 2.5 focuses on making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and assistive tech.

## **What Is Guideline 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms?**

> "Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where necessary."

Guideline 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#concurrent-input-mechanisms).

- Users must be able to switch between input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.) at any time.
- Applies to all web content and applications.
- Exception: restriction is essential for security or function.

This ensures users can switch between input methods as needed, supporting accessibility and flexibility for everyone.

---

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Users may need to switch between input methods for accessibility or convenience.
- **Legal Compliance:** Concurrent Input Mechanisms is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Improves flexibility and user experience for all users.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on concurrent input mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html).

---

## **What Needs Concurrent Input Mechanisms?**

- Touch interfaces
- Keyboard and mouse inputs
- Any feature supporting multiple input methods

All must allow users to switch between input methods at any time.

---

## **How to Make Concurrent Input Mechanisms Accessible**

- Allow users to switch between input methods
- Do not restrict input modalities unless necessary
- Document input method options
- Test with users who use multiple input methods

For more, see the [W3C's Concurrent Input Mechanisms Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G217).

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Restricting input to a single method
- Not documenting input method options
- Not testing with users who use multiple input devices

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 2.5.6 in WCAG 2.2**

- **Level A:** Not applicable for this guideline.
- **Level AA:** Not applicable for this guideline.
- **Level AAA:** Requires users can switch between input methods unless restricted by platform. This is the core requirement for 2.5.6 and is mandatory for AAA conformance.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html).

---

## **Quick Checklist**

- Users can switch between input methods
- Input method options are documented
- Tested with users who use multiple input methods

---

## **Summary**

Guideline 2.5.6 is essential for helping users interact with your site. By allowing users to switch between input methods, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Test your site regularly and make input flexibility a core part of your development process.
