## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that users can easily interact with and understand web content, especially when authenticating or logging in.

## **Guideline 3.3: Input Assistance**

Guideline 3.3 focuses on helping users avoid and correct mistakes when entering information, including during authentication.

## **What Is Guideline 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)?**

> "For each step in an authentication process, at least one method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test or the ability to transcribe information, unless an alternative is provided."

Guideline 3.3.9 builds on 3.3.8 by requiring that authentication does not depend on cognitive function tests or transcription (e.g., copying codes), unless an accessible alternative is available.

- Helps users with cognitive, memory, or motor disabilities
- Essential for fully accessible login and authentication
- Applies to all authentication steps and methods
