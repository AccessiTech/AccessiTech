**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

_**Notice:** WCAG Guideline 4.1.1 (Parsing) is being removed in the upcoming WCAG 2.2 update. For more details, see [Deque: WCAG 2.2 Removes 4.1.1 Parsing and How axe-core is Impacted](https://www.deque.com/blog/wcag-2-2-removes-4-1-1-parsing-and-how-axe-core-is-impacted/)._

## **Guideline 4: Robust**

The Robust principle ensures that web content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## **Guideline 4.1: Compatible**

Guideline 4.1 focuses on making sure content can be reliably interpreted by a wide range of technologies.

## **What Is Guideline 4.1.1 Parsing?**

<!-- [Illustration: Code editor showing valid HTML markup] -->

> "Content is parsed correctly by user agents, ensuring assistive technologies can interpret it."

Guideline 4.1.1 requires that your code is well-formed and free of errors that could confuse browsers or assistive technologies.

- Ensures content is interpreted correctly by all user agents
- Essential for accessibility and future compatibility
- Applies to all markup languages (HTML, SVG, etc.)

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: User with screen reader, code icon, and browser] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Correct parsing helps assistive technologies interpret content.
- **Legal Compliance:** Parsing is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents errors and improves accessibility for all users.

## **What Needs to Be Parsed Correctly?**

<!-- [Grid: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, all with code icons] -->

- HTML markup
- CSS and JavaScript
- Any content interpreted by user agents

## **How to Ensure Correct Parsing**

<!-- [Side-by-side code snippets: Valid markup, invalid markup]
[Example: Settings panel for code validation] -->

- Use valid, well-formed markup
- Document coding conventions
- Test with validators and assistive technologies

For more, see the [W3C's Parsing Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H88).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with valid code, right side with invalid code] -->

- Invalid or poorly formed markup
- Not documenting coding conventions
- Not testing with validators or assistive technologies

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 4.1.1 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** Requires content is parsed correctly by user agents. This is the core requirement for 4.1.1 and is mandatory for basic accessibility.
- **Level AA:** For Guideline 4.1.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AA.
- **Level AAA:** For Guideline 4.1.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AAA.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 4.1.1 Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/parsing.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for each item (code, validation, screen reader, etc.)] -->

- All markup is valid and well-formed
- Coding conventions are documented
- Tested with validators and assistive technologies

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User reading a web page with valid code] -->

Guideline 4.1.1 is essential for helping users access your site. By ensuring correct parsing, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Test your site regularly and make code validation a core part of your development process.
