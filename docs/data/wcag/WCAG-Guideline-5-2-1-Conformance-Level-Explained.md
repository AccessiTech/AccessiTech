## **What Is Conformance Level?**

Section 5.2.1 of WCAG 2.1 defines the three levels of accessibility conformance: **Level A**, **Level AA**, and **Level AAA**. Each level builds on the previous one, with more requirements for higher levels.

- **Level A (Minimum):** The web page satisfies all Level A success criteria, or provides a conforming alternate version.
- **Level AA:** The web page satisfies all Level A and Level AA success criteria, or provides a Level AA conforming alternate version.
- **Level AAA:** The web page satisfies all Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA success criteria, or provides a Level AAA conforming alternate version.

A conforming alternate version is a version of the content that meets the required level and provides all the same information and functionality.

## **How Do the Levels Work?**

- **Level A** is the most basic level of accessibility. It addresses the most critical barriers for users with disabilities.
- **Level AA** includes all Level A requirements plus additional criteria that address a wider range of barriers. Most organizations aim for Level AA.
- **Level AAA** is the highest level, with the most comprehensive set of requirements. It is not always possible or practical to meet all AAA criteria for all content.

> **Note:** Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level.

> **Note:** It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites, because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content.

## **Why Does This Matter?**

- Set realistic accessibility goals
- Make accurate conformance claims
