## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that web content is clear and predictable, including how controls and components are identified.

## **Guideline 3.2: Predictable**

Guideline 3.2 focuses on making web pages behave in ways users expect, especially regarding controls and repeated elements.

## **What Is Guideline 3.2.4 Consistent Identification?**

> "Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently."

Guideline 3.2.4 requires that controls, icons, and components that perform the same function are labeled and identified the same way across your site.

- Helps users learn and recognize controls
- Essential for users with cognitive and visual disabilities
- Applies to all repeated controls, icons, and components

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Consistency reduces confusion and cognitive load

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Using different labels or icons for the same function
- Changing the identification of controls between pages
- Not using templates or shared components for controls

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.2.4 in WCAG 2.2**

- **Level AA:** Requires consistent identification of controls and components.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 3.2.4.
