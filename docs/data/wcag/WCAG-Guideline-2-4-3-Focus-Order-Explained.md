## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure users can navigate your site in a logical, predictable order using the keyboard.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Focus Order is about ensuring the order of navigation matches the visual and logical structure of the page.

## **What Is Guideline 2.4.3 Focus Order?**

<!-- [Illustration: User tabbing through a web page in a logical order] -->

> "If a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability."

Guideline 2.4.3 Focus Order is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#focus-order).

- Users must be able to navigate through interactive elements in a logical, predictable order.
- Applies to forms, menus, dialogs, and any focusable content.
- The focus order should match the visual and logical structure of the page.

This ensures users can navigate your site in a logical, predictable order, supporting accessibility and usability for all.
