## **What Does "Full Pages" Mean in WCAG?**

Section 5.2.2 of WCAG 2.1 states that conformance (and conformance level) is for full web page(s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a web page is excluded.

- **Conformance must apply to the entire web page.**
- You cannot claim conformance for just a portion of a page.

A "full page" includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented for different screen sizes (such as responsive layouts). All these variations must conform, or have a conforming alternate version, for the page to be considered conformant.

---

## **Key Notes from the Specification**

- **Alternatives:** For conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content (like a long description or alternative video presentation) are considered part of the page if they can be obtained directly from the page.
- **Third-Party Content:** If a page cannot conform due to content outside the author's control, a Statement of Partial Conformance may be considered.
- **Responsive Design:** Every version of a page (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop) must conform for the page to be considered accessible.

---

## **Why Is This Important?**

- **Prevents "cherry-picking":** You can't claim a page is accessible if only some parts are.
- **Ensures a consistent experience:** All users, on all devices, get the same level of accessibility.
- **Supports legal and ethical claims:** Conformance claims must be honest and comprehensive.

---

## **Examples**

- If your site has a desktop and a mobile version, both must meet the same accessibility requirements.
- If a video has an alternative text transcript available directly from the page, both the video and the transcript are considered part of the page for conformance.
