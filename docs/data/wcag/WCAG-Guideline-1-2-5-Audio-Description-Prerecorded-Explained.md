# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.5: Audio Description (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)?**

> "Audio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media."

Guideline 1.2.5 is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#audio-description-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded video content with audio must have an audio description track.
- Audio descriptions narrate important visual information for users who are blind or have low vision.
- Audio descriptions help users understand what’s happening on screen when it’s not clear from the audio alone.

This ensures everyone can access the information in your videos, regardless of vision ability.

---

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Audio descriptions make video content accessible to users who are blind or have low vision.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level AA requirement in WCAG 2.2 and referenced in accessibility laws worldwide.
- **Usability:** Audio descriptions help all users understand visual content, especially in complex or fast-paced videos.

## **What Needs Audio Description?**

- Prerecorded video content with audio (webinars, tutorials, interviews)
- Online courses and training videos
- Marketing and promotional videos

All such media must have an audio description track.

---

## **How to Provide Audio Description**

- Add an audio description track to your videos
- Ensure descriptions are accurate and complete
- Make audio descriptions easy to enable and access
- Test with users and assistive technology

For more, see the [W3C's audio description docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-description-prerecorded.html).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- No audio description for video content
- Incomplete or inaccurate descriptions
- Hiding audio descriptions from users
- Not testing with users who are blind or have low vision

Audit your site regularly and use accessibility checkers to ensure all video content has proper audio descriptions. For more, see the [FCC's Audio Description requirements](https://www.fcc.gov/audio-description).

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 1.2.5 in WCAG 2.2**

- **Level A:** No requirement for 1.2.5.
