# **WCAG Guideline 2.3.3: Animation from Interactions Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes protecting users from unnecessary motion that could cause discomfort or distraction.

## **Guideline 2.3: Seizures and Physical Reactions**

Guideline 2.3 focuses on preventing content that could trigger seizures or other physical reactions, including motion sensitivity from animations.

## **What Is Guideline 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions?**

<!-- [Illustration: User toggling off animation after clicking a button] -->

> "Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed."

Guideline 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#animation-from-interactions).

- Users must be able to turn off non-essential motion animations triggered by their actions (e.g., scrolling, clicking, hovering).
- Exceptions: animations essential to functionality or information.
- Applies to parallax effects, smooth scrolling, transitions, and other UI animations.

This ensures users can disable non-essential motion animation and have a comfortable experience.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: User with motion sensitivity, toggle switch, and safe animation] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Motion animation can cause discomfort or trigger vestibular disorders in some users.
- **Legal Compliance:** Animation from Interactions is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents discomfort and improves experience for all users.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on animation from interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).

## **What Needs to Support Animation Control?**

<!-- [Grid: Buttons, toggles, sliders, all with animation icons] -->

- Buttons and toggles
- Sliders and carousels
- Any feature with motion animation triggered by interaction

All must provide a way to disable non-essential motion animations.

## **How to Make Animation from Interactions Accessible**

<!-- [Side-by-side code snippets: Animation enabled/disabled, toggle UI]
[Example: Settings panel for animation control] -->

- Allow users to disable non-essential motion animation
- Use safe animation techniques
- Document animation policies
- Test with users who are sensitive to motion

For more, see the [W3C's Animation from Interactions Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C39).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with animation toggle, right side with no control] -->

- No way to disable motion animation
- Animation essential to functionality not documented
- Not testing with users who are sensitive to motion

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 2.3.3 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** Not applicable for this guideline.
- **Level AA:** Not applicable for this guideline.
- **Level AAA:** Requires users can disable motion animation triggered by interaction, unless essential. This is the core requirement for 2.3.3 and is mandatory for AAA conformance.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for each item (animation, toggle, safe, etc.)] -->

- Users can disable non-essential motion animation
- Animation policies are documented
- Tested with users who are sensitive to motion

---

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User toggling off animation in a web app] -->

Guideline 2.3.3 is essential for preventing discomfort and supporting users with motion sensitivity. By allowing users to disable non-essential animation, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Test your site regularly and make animation control a core part of your development process.
