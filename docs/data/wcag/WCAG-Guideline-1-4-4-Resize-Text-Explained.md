# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.4: Resize Text Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that text remains readable when resized.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Users with low vision often need to increase text size to read comfortably.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.4 Resize Text?**

Guideline 1.4.4 Resize Text is a requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#resize-text).

- Users must be able to increase text size up to 200% without losing content or functionality.
- Applies to all text except captions and images of text.

## **How to Meet Guideline 1.4.4**

<!-- [Side-by-side: Web page at normal size vs. at 200% zoom, both fully functional] -->

- Use relative units (em, rem, %) for font sizes and layout
- Avoid fixed pixel heights/widths for containers
- Test your site at 200% zoom in browsers
- Ensure no content is cut off or overlaps
- Avoid images of text where possible
