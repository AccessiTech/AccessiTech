# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.8: Media Alternative (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded)?**

> "A full text alternative for synchronized media including any interaction is provided."

Guideline 1.2.8 is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#media-alternative-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded synchronized media (video with audio) should have a full text alternative that describes all visual and audio content, including interactions.
- This allows users who cannot access audio or video to get all the information in text form.
- The text alternative should be easy to find and use.

This ensures that users who are deaf-blind or have other disabilities can fully understand your media content.

---

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Full text alternatives provide access for users who cannot see or hear media content.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Enhances understanding for users who prefer or require text over audio/video.

For more, see [W3C's media alternative docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/media-alternative-prerecorded.html).

## **What Needs a Media Alternative?**

- Prerecorded synchronized media (video with audio)
- Any media with both visual and audio content

All such media should have a full text alternative available.

---

## **How to Provide a Media Alternative**

- Write a detailed transcript describing all audio, visual, and interactive elements
- Make the transcript easy to find and use
- Ensure the transcript is accurate and complete
- Update the transcript if the media content changes

For more, see [W3C's media alternative docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/media-alternative-prerecorded.html).

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- No full text alternative for synchronized media
- Transcript that is incomplete or inaccurate
- Hiding the transcript from users
- Not updating the transcript when media changes

Audit your site regularly and use accessibility checkers to ensure all media has proper full text alternatives. For more, see [University of Washington's guide to transcripts for accessible media](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/videos/transcripts/).

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 1.2.8 in WCAG 2.2**

- **Level A:** No requirement for 1.2.8.
- **Level AA:** No requirement for 1.2.8.
- **Level AAA:** Requires a full text alternative for all prerecorded synchronized media. This is the core requirement for 1.2.8 and is mandatory for AAA conformance.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/media-alternative-prerecorded.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

- All prerecorded synchronized media has a full text alternative
- Transcript is accurate and complete
- Transcript is easy to find and use
- Transcript is updated if media changes
- Tested with users and assistive technology

---

## **Summary**

Guideline 1.2.8 is essential for making media content accessible to users who require text alternatives. By providing a full text transcript, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet AAA requirements. Make full text alternatives a standard part of your media production process for maximum inclusion.
