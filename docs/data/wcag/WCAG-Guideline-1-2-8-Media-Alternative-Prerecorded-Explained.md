# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.8: Media Alternative (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Video player and a full text transcript side by side] -->

> "A full text alternative for synchronized media including any interaction is provided."

Guideline 1.2.8 is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#media-alternative-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded synchronized media (video with audio) should have a full text alternative that describes all visual and audio content, including interactions.
- This allows users who cannot access audio or video to get all the information in text form.
- The text alternative should be easy to find and use.

This ensures that users who are deaf-blind or have other disabilities can fully understand your media content.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Video player, full text transcript, and user with braille display] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Full text alternatives provide access for users who cannot see or hear media content.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Enhances understanding for users who prefer or require text over audio/video.
