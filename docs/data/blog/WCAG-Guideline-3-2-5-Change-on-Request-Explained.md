# **WCAG Guideline 3.2.5: Change on Request Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that web content behaves in ways users expect, especially regarding changes in context or content.

## **Guideline 3.2: Predictable**

Guideline 3.2 focuses on making web pages behave in ways users expect, especially regarding changes triggered by user actions.

## **What Is Guideline 3.2.5 Change on Request?**

[Illustration: User clicking a button to trigger a change, no automatic changes]

> "Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes."

Guideline 3.2.5 requires that changes in context (like navigation, popups, or content updates) only happen when the user requests them, or users can turn off automatic changes.

- Gives users control over their experience
- Prevents confusion and disorientation
- Applies to all changes of context (navigation, popups, content updates)

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: User with assistive tech, warning icon, and control button]

- **Keyboard and Screen Reader Users:** Need to control when changes happen
- **All Users:** Predictable behavior builds trust and usability
- **Accessibility:** Surprises can disorient or frustrate users

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.2.5**

[Side-by-side: Good example (user clicks to trigger change) vs. Bad example (automatic navigation)]

- Require explicit user action (click, tap, Enter) to trigger changes
- Provide a mechanism to turn off automatic changes if needed
- Test all interactive elements for unexpected changes
- Review custom widgets for change-on-request behavior

For more, see the [W3C's Change on Request Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G76).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with user-initiated change, right side with automatic change]

- Triggering navigation or popups automatically without user action
- Failing to provide a way to turn off automatic changes
- Not testing with keyboard and assistive technology
