# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.9: Audio-only (Live) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.9 Audio-only (Live)?**

[Illustration: Live audio stream with real-time captions]

> "An alternative for time-based media that presents equivalent information for live audio-only content is provided."

Guideline 1.2.9 is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#audio-only-live).

- All live audio-only content (like radio broadcasts or live podcasts) should have a real-time text alternative, such as live captions or a transcript.
- This ensures users who are deaf or hard of hearing can access the information as it happens.
- The alternative should be as accurate and timely as possible.

This ensures that everyone can participate in live audio events, regardless of hearing ability.
