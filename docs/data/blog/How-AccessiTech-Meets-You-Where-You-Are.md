# **Accessibility Isn’t One-Size-Fits-All: How AccessiTech Meets You Where You Are**

Hi, I’m Conor, founder of [AccessiTech LLC](https://www.accessi.tech/). As a developer with Psoriatic Arthritis, I’ve experienced firsthand how digital barriers can lock people out—not because the technology isn’t advanced enough, but because accessibility is too often an afterthought.

At AccessiTech, I don’t just offer services—I provide tailored solutions that bridge the gap between compliance and real-world usability. Whether you’re a startup, a seasoned developer, or an ally looking to make a difference, here’s how we can work together to build a more inclusive digital world.

## **1. Accessibility Audits: Finding the Barriers You Didn’t Know Existed**

Most accessibility audits focus on technical compliance—WCAG checklists, automated scans, and legal requirements. But what about the barriers that slip through the cracks?

At AccessiTech, [audits go beyond the basics](https://www.accessi.tech#consultation). I combine industry standards with lived experience to identify pain points that affect real users. This means:

- 🔬 **Comprehensive analysis** of your app’s accessibility (not just a checklist)
- 👩‍🔬 **Real-world scenario testing** (e.g., how does your app perform for someone with hand tremors?)
- 🛠️ **Actionable recommendations** (not just a list of errors)
- 📊 **Prioritized fixes** based on user impact (because not all issues are created equal)

Accessibility isn’t about checking boxes. It’s about ensuring no one is left behind.

## **2. Quality Assurance Engineering: Testing for the Real World**

Automated accessibility tools catch, at best, 30% of issues. The rest? They require a human touch—one that understands how people with disabilities actually navigate digital spaces.

My [QA engineering services](https://www.accessi.tech#qa) focus on:

- 🔍 **Engineering Analysis** (I'll debug your code for you and offer solutions)
- 👷‍♀️ **Manual testing** (because no algorithm can replicate lived experience)
- ♿️ **End-to-end accessibility integration** (from wireframes to deployment)
- 🧪 **User testing** with real people (because your app should work for everyone, not just the majority)

If your team is serious about accessibility, QA shouldn’t be an afterthought—it should be baked into every step.

## **3. Mentorship: Flattening the Learning Curve**

The coding world’s steep learning curve gets even steeper when you live with a disability. Whether it’s chronic pain, limited mobility, or cognitive differences, traditional learning methods don’t always work.

That’s why I offer [**one-on-one mentorship**](https://www.accessi.tech#mentorship) for aspiring developers and designers, focusing on:

- 🧑‍💻 **Personalized learning plans** (because everyone learns differently)
- 💡 **Pro-tips from a pro** (let my countless hours of trial and error save you time)
- 🦾 **Accessibility-first best practices** (so you build inclusively from day one)
- 📈 **Career navigation** (how to advocate for yourself in tech spaces)

If you’ve ever felt like the tech industry wasn’t built for you, let’s change that—together.

## **4. Open-Source Tools: Democratizing Accessibility**

I believe accessibility shouldn’t be locked behind paywalls or proprietary systems. That’s why AccessiTech [develops and promotes **free, modular, open-source tools**](https://www.accessi.tech#production) designed to make inclusive development easier.

Some of my current projects include:

- 🔭 Serverless solutions for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- ⚗️ Single and Multi-page React App Starter Kits
- ⚙️ Accessibility Options Widgets (forget overlays!)
- 🧩 Modular components for easy integration into existing projects

Open-source isn’t just about code—it’s about community. And everyone deserves a seat at the table.
