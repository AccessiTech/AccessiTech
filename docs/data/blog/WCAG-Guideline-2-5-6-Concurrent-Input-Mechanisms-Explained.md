# **WCAG Guideline 2.5.6: Concurrent Input Mechanisms Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes letting users switch between input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.) as needed.

## **Guideline 2.5: Input Modalities**

Guideline 2.5 focuses on making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods, including keyboard, mouse, touch, and assistive tech.

## **What Is Guideline 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms?**

[Illustration: User switching between keyboard, mouse, and touch input]

> "Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform, except where necessary."

Guideline 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#concurrent-input-mechanisms).

- Users must be able to switch between input methods (keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.) at any time.
- Applies to all web content and applications.
- Exception: restriction is essential for security or function.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: User with multiple input devices, switching between them]

- **Accessibility:** Some users need to switch between input methods due to fatigue, injury, or preference.
- **Inclusivity:** Supports users with a wide range of abilities and devices.
- **Legal Compliance:** Concurrent Input Mechanisms is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Improves flexibility and user experience for everyone.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on concurrent input mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html).

## **What Needs to Support Concurrent Input?**

[Grid: Web app, form, and navigation, all operable by keyboard, mouse, and touch]

- Web applications and forms
- Navigation menus
- Any interactive content

All must allow users to switch between input methods at any time.

## **How to Meet Guideline 2.5.6**

[Side-by-side: App that allows switching input vs. app that restricts input]

- Do not lock users into a single input method
- Support keyboard, mouse, and touch input
- Avoid disabling input methods unless essential
- Test with users who use multiple input devices

For more, see the [W3C's Concurrent Input Mechanisms Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G217).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with multiple input options, right side with only one]

- Restricting input to only mouse, keyboard, or touch
- Disabling input methods without a valid reason
- Not testing with users who use multiple input devices

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 2.5.6 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A & AA:** No requirement for concurrent input methods.
- **Level AAA:** Requires support for switching between input methods at any time.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Icons for keyboard, mouse, touch, and switching]

- Users can switch between input methods at any time
- No unnecessary restrictions on input methods
- Tested with users who use multiple input devices

## **Summary**

[Illustration: User switching from mouse to keyboard to touch on a web app]

Guideline 2.5.6 ensures users can use the input method that works best for them, supporting flexibility and accessibility. Always allow switching and test for accessibility.

We’ll continue with Guideline 2.6.1 and beyond, covering more ways to make your site accessible for everyone.

*Accessibility means flexibility—let users choose how they interact!*
