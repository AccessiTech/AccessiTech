## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that users can easily interact with and understand web content, especially when authenticating or logging in.

## **Guideline 3.3: Input Assistance**

Guideline 3.3 focuses on helping users avoid and correct mistakes when entering information, including during authentication.

## **What Is Guideline 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)?**

[Illustration: Login form with accessible options and a user icon]

> "For each step in an authentication process, at least one method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test, unless an alternative is provided."

Guideline 3.3.8 requires that authentication (like logging in) does not depend solely on cognitive function tests (e.g., puzzles, remembering passwords), unless an accessible alternative is available.

- Helps users with cognitive, memory, or learning disabilities
- Essential for accessible login and authentication
- Applies to all authentication steps and methods

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Login icon, user with assistive tech, and accessible options]

- **All Users:** May struggle with memory or cognitive tests
- **Users with Disabilities:** Need alternatives to puzzles or password recall
- **Accessibility:** Ensures everyone can log in or authenticate

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.3.8**

[Side-by-side: Good example (password manager, copy-paste allowed) vs. Bad example (puzzle or memory test)]

- Allow use of password managers and copy-paste
- Provide alternatives to cognitive function tests (e.g., email link, biometric)
- Avoid requiring users to solve puzzles or remember complex information
- Test authentication with users with cognitive disabilities

For more, see the [W3C's Accessible Authentication Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G218).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with accessible login, right side with puzzle or memory test]

- Requiring only cognitive function tests for authentication
- Blocking password managers or copy-paste
- Not providing accessible alternatives

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.3.8 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level AA:** Requires accessible authentication methods (minimum).
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 3.3.8.
- **Level A:** Not applicable (3.3.8 is a Level AA requirement).

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html).
