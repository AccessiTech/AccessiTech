**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

## **Guideline 4: Robust**

The Robust principle ensures that web content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## **Guideline 4.1: Compatible**

Guideline 4.1 focuses on making sure content can be reliably interpreted by a wide range of technologies.

## **What Is Guideline 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value?**

[Illustration: UI components with labels and accessibility icons]

> "For all user interface components (including form elements, links, and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies."

Guideline 4.1.2 requires that all interactive elements are accessible to assistive technologies by exposing their name, role, and value.

- Ensures UI components are usable with screen readers and other assistive tech
- Essential for accessible forms, buttons, and custom widgets
- Applies to all interactive elements, including those generated by scripts

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: UI component icon, screen reader, and user with assistive tech]

- **All Users:** Need to interact with forms and controls
- **Assistive Technology Users:** Rely on programmatic access to names, roles, and values
- **Accessibility:** Enables full participation for users with disabilities

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html).

## **What Needs Name, Role, Value?**

[Grid: Form fields, buttons, links, and custom widgets]

- All form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc.)
- Buttons and links
- Custom widgets and components

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 4.1.2**

[Side-by-side: Good example (labeled button, accessible form) vs. Bad example (unlabeled custom widget)]

- Use semantic HTML for standard controls
- Add ARIA attributes for custom components
- Ensure names, roles, and values are programmatically exposed
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools

For more, see the [W3C's Name, Role, Value Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA1).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with accessible controls, right side with unlabeled or inaccessible controls]

- Using custom controls without ARIA roles or labels
- Failing to update state or value programmatically
- Not testing with assistive technology

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 4.1.2 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A:** Requires name, role, and value for all UI components.
- **Level AA:** No additional requirements for 4.1.2.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 4.1.2.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Icons for label, role, and value]

- All UI components have programmatically determinable name, role, and value
- ARIA attributes used for custom controls
- Tested with screen readers and accessibility tools

## **Summary**

[Illustration: User interacting with accessible UI components]

Guideline 4.1.2 ensures that all interactive elements are accessible to assistive technologies. Use semantic HTML and ARIA to expose names, roles, and values.
