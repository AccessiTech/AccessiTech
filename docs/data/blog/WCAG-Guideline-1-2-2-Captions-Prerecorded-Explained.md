# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.2: Captions (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)?**

[Illustration: Video player with captions enabled]

> "Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such."

Guideline 1.2.2 is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#captions-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded video content with audio must have captions.
- Captions should accurately reflect spoken dialogue and important sounds.
- Captions help users who are deaf, hard of hearing, or in environments where audio can’t be played.

This ensures everyone can access the information in your videos, regardless of hearing ability or environment.

## **Why Does It Matter?**
