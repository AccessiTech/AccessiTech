## **What Is Accessibility Support?**

[Illustration: Support document or checklist with accessibility icons]

Accessibility support means that the technologies, features, and content you use or create are compatible with assistive technologies and accessibility APIs, and that this compatibility is documented and communicated.

- Ensures users know what is supported and what is not
- Applies to AR, VR, IoT, and all new platforms
- Helps developers and users make informed decisions

---

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Support icon, compatibility chart, and user with assistive tech]

- **All Users:** Need to know if their assistive tech will work
- **Developers:** Need to understand compatibility and limitations
- **Accessibility:** Transparency builds trust and enables better choices

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on Accessibility Support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).
