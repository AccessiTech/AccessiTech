## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes giving users control over moving, blinking, or auto-updating content that can be distracting or inaccessible.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and control over content that changes or moves. This is especially important for users with cognitive or visual disabilities.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide?**

[Illustration: Carousel with pause, stop, and hide controls]

> "For any moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, a mechanism is available for the user to pause, stop, or hide it."

Guideline 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide is a requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#pause-stop-hide).

- Users must be able to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, or auto-updating content.
- Applies to carousels, news tickers, auto-refreshing feeds, and similar elements.
- Does not apply to animations that are essential or last less than five seconds.
