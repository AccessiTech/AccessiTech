# **WCAG Conformance Levels Explained: A, AA, and AAA**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

## **Introduction: Why Conformance Levels Matter**

Welcome back to our accessibility series! In our [last post](./The-Four-Principles-of-Accessibility-POUR.md), we explored the POUR principles that form the foundation of accessible design. Now, let’s demystify the three WCAG conformance levels—A, AA, and AAA—and what they mean for your website or app.

---

## **What Are WCAG Conformance Levels?**

WCAG guidelines are organized into three levels of conformance:

- **Level A:** The minimum level. Addresses the most basic web accessibility features.
- **Level AA:** The mid-range. Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
- **Level AAA:** The highest level. The gold standard for accessibility, but not always possible for all content.

Each level builds on the previous one. To meet AA, you must also meet all A criteria; to meet AAA, you must meet all A and AA criteria as well.

## **Level A: The Essentials**

**What it means:**

- Your site is accessible at a basic level.
- No content is completely inaccessible to people with disabilities.

**Examples of Level A requirements:**

- All images have alt text.
- Videos have captions.
- Content is navigable by keyboard.

**Tip:** Level A is a starting point, not the finish line. Most organizations are required to meet at least Level AA.

## **Level AA: The Standard for Most Sites**

**What it means:**

- Your site removes the most significant barriers for users with disabilities.
- This is the legal requirement in many countries (e.g., US, EU, Canada).

**Examples of Level AA requirements:**

- Color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.
- Headings and labels are clear and descriptive.
- Navigation is consistent across pages.
- Error messages are specific and helpful.

**Tip:** Aim for Level AA as your default. It balances accessibility with practicality.

---

## **Level AAA: The Gold Standard**

**What it means:**

- Your site is as accessible as possible, going above and beyond legal requirements.
- Not all content can meet AAA (e.g., live audio captions), but strive for it where you can.

**Examples of Level AAA requirements:**

- Sign language interpretation for videos.
- Color contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text.
- No timing on any part of the content.

**Tip:** Use AAA as inspiration for continuous improvement, even if you can’t meet every criterion.

---

## **How to Check Your Level**

- Use automated tools (like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse) to scan your site.
- Manually test with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Review the [W3C Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) for detailed criteria.

---

## **Summary: Which Level Should You Target?**

- **Level A:** Absolute minimum—rarely enough on its own.
- **Level AA:** The practical, legal, and ethical standard for most organizations.
- **Level AAA:** The ideal—strive for it where possible.

**Next Up:**

In our next post, we’ll take a step back and look at WCAG itself as a living, evolving standard—how it’s developed, who maintains it, and why its structure matters. This "meta" overview will set the stage for a new series where we’ll break down each WCAG guideline and success criterion, one post at a time.

_Accessibility is a journey—each level brings you closer to a web for everyone!_
