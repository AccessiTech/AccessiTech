# **WCAG Guideline 2.3.3: Animation from Interactions Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes protecting users from unnecessary motion that could cause discomfort or distraction.

## **Guideline 2.3: Seizures and Physical Reactions**

Guideline 2.3 focuses on preventing content that could trigger seizures or other physical reactions, including motion sensitivity from animations.

## **What Is Guideline 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions?**

[Illustration: Toggle switch for animations and a user interacting with a UI]

> "Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed."

Guideline 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#animation-from-interactions).

- Users must be able to turn off non-essential motion animations triggered by their actions (e.g., scrolling, clicking, hovering).
- Exceptions: animations essential to functionality or information.
- Applies to parallax effects, smooth scrolling, transitions, and other UI animations.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: User with motion sensitivity, toggle for animations, and warning icon]

- **Accessibility:** Motion can cause discomfort, distraction, or even nausea for some users.
- **Inclusivity:** Supports users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity.
- **Legal Compliance:** Animation from Interactions is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Improves comfort and focus for all users.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on animation from interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).

## **What Needs to Support Animation Control?**

[Grid: Parallax effects, smooth scrolling, UI transitions, all with animation toggle]

- Parallax and background motion effects
- Smooth scrolling and page transitions
- UI element animations (e.g., buttons, menus)

All must provide a way to disable non-essential motion animations.

## **How to Meet Guideline 2.3.3**

[Side-by-side: UI with motion animations vs. UI with animations disabled]

- Provide a toggle or respect system settings (e.g., prefers-reduced-motion)
- Only use essential animations for functionality or information
- Test with users who are sensitive to motion

For more, see the [W3C's Animation from Interactions Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C39).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with animation toggle, right side with forced motion]

- No way to disable motion animations
- Ignoring system settings for reduced motion
- Using non-essential animations for decoration

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 2.3.3 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A & AA:** No requirement for disabling motion animations.
- **Level AAA:** Requires users can disable non-essential motion animations triggered by interaction.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Icons for animation toggle, motion, and user]

- Users can disable non-essential motion animations
- System settings for reduced motion are respected
- Only essential animations are used
- Tested with users who are sensitive to motion

## **Summary**

[Illustration: User toggling off motion animations in a web app]

Guideline 2.3.3 ensures users can turn off non-essential motion animations, supporting those with motion sensitivity. Always provide a toggle or respect system settings for reduced motion.
