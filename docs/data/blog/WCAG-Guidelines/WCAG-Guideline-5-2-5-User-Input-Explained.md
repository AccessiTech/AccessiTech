## **Guideline 5: Emerging Technologies**

The Emerging Technologies principle ensures that new and evolving web technologies are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## **Guideline 5.2: Platform Accessibility**

Guideline 5.2 focuses on making sure that both platforms and the content they deliver are accessible, including how users provide input.

## **What Is Guideline 5.2.5 User Input?**

[Illustration: User entering information on a futuristic device with accessibility icons]

> "Platforms and content must ensure that all user input methods (touch, voice, gesture, etc.) are accessible to users with disabilities."

Guideline 5.2.5 requires that all ways users interact with new platforms—whether by touch, voice, gesture, or other means—are accessible to everyone.

- Ensures all users can provide input, regardless of ability
- Applies to AR/VR, IoT, and other new platforms
- Covers all input methods, including emerging ones

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Input icon, accessibility settings, and user with assistive tech]

- **All Users:** Need to interact with platforms in ways that work for them
- **Users with Disabilities:** Rely on accessible input methods
- **Accessibility:** Empowers everyone to participate fully
