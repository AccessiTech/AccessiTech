## **Guideline 5: Emerging Technologies**

The Emerging Technologies principle ensures that new and evolving web technologies are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## **Guideline 5.1: General**

Guideline 5.1 focuses on general accessibility requirements for technologies not explicitly covered by earlier guidelines.

## **What Is Guideline 5.1.1 General?**

[Illustration: Web page with a generic accessibility icon and futuristic elements]

> "For content implemented using technologies not addressed in the earlier guidelines, the content is accessible to users with disabilities."

Guideline 5.1.1 requires that any new or emerging technology used on the web must be accessible, even if not specifically mentioned in WCAG.

- Ensures accessibility for all users, regardless of technology
- Applies to AR, VR, IoT, and other emerging platforms
- Fills gaps not covered by previous guidelines

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Accessibility icon, futuristic device, and user with assistive tech]

- **All Users:** Should benefit from new technologies
- **Assistive Technology Users:** Need access to emerging platforms
- **Accessibility:** Keeps the web inclusive as it evolves

## **What Needs to Meet General Accessibility?**

[Grid: AR/VR devices, IoT interfaces, and new web technologies]

- Augmented and virtual reality content
- Internet of Things (IoT) interfaces
- Any new or experimental web technology

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 5.1.1**

[Side-by-side: Good example (accessible AR/VR interface) vs. Bad example (inaccessible new tech)]

- Apply accessibility best practices to all new technologies
- Test with users of assistive technology
- Document accessibility features and limitations

For more, see the [W3C's Emerging Technologies Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with accessible new tech, right side with inaccessible device]

- Ignoring accessibility in new or experimental tech
- Not testing with real users
- Failing to document accessibility limitations

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 5.1.1 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A:** Requires general accessibility for new technologies.
- **Level AA:** No additional requirements for 5.1.1.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 5.1.1.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 5.1.1 General](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).
