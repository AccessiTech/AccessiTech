The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure every link is clear and meaningful in its context.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Link Purpose (In Context) is about ensuring users know where a link will take them.

## **What Is Guideline 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)?**

> "The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its context."

Guideline 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#link-purpose-in-context).

- Every link must be clear about its destination or function, either from the link text alone or with surrounding context.
- Applies to navigation menus, lists, buttons, and inline links.
- Avoids vague links like "Click here" or "Read more" without context.
