# 1.4.1 Use of Color

Color should not be the only means of conveying information or indicating an action. This guideline is about making sure that all users, including those with color blindness or other visual impairments, can access the information and functionality of your site.

## Why It Matters

Color blindness affects a significant portion of the population, and many more people have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. If your site uses color as the only means of conveying information, you risk excluding a large number of users.

## How to Meet This Guideline

- **Provide text alternatives** for any information that is conveyed with color alone. For example, if you use red text to indicate an error, provide an error message in text form as well.
- **Use color in conjunction with other indicators**. For example, use an exclamation mark icon in addition to red text to indicate an error.
- **Test your site** with color blindness simulators to ensure that your information is accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.
