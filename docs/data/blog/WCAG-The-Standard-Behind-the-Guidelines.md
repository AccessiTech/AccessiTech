## **Introduction: Why Look at WCAG as a Standard?**

Welcome back! In our [last post](./WCAG-Conformance-Levels-Explained-A-AA-AAA.md), we explored the three WCAG conformance levels. Now, before we dive into the individual guidelines, let’s zoom out and look at WCAG itself: what it is, how it’s made, and why it’s the backbone of digital accessibility.

## **What Is WCAG?**

The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** are a set of technical standards for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. They’re developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, specifically the **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)**.

---

## **How Is WCAG Developed?**

- **Collaborative Process:** WCAG is created by experts, advocates, and organizations from around the world.
- **Open for Feedback:** Drafts are published for public comment, so anyone can contribute.
- **Regular Updates:** WCAG evolves to address new technologies, user needs, and legal requirements (e.g., 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and the upcoming 3.0).

---

## **How Is WCAG Structured?**

- **Principles:** POUR—Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
- **Guidelines:** 13 broad goals under the four principles.
- **Success Criteria:** Testable requirements at Levels A, AA, and AAA.
- **Techniques & Failures:** Practical examples of how to meet (or not meet) each criterion.

---

## **Why Does WCAG Matter?**

- **Legal Compliance:** Many countries reference WCAG in accessibility laws.
- **Universal Design:** Following WCAG helps everyone, not just people with disabilities.
- **Future-Proofing:** WCAG is designed to adapt to new tech and user needs.
