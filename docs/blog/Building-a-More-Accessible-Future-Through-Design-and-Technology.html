<p>Hi, I’m Conor, the founder of <a href="https://www.accessi.tech/">AccessiTech LLC</a>. As someone living with Psoriatic Arthritis, I know firsthand how disabilities—whether physical, cognitive, or sensory—can create barriers in everyday life. There are days when chronic pain in my hands makes it difficult to work, and ambulatory limitations can prevent me from doing the things I love. But I also know that technology has the power to break down these barriers. That’s why I started AccessiTech—to make the web a more inclusive place for everyone. We have the technology, the prerogative, and, I believe, a civic responsibility to do so.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of resources on accessibility and technology as a means of creating social change, approaching the subject as an outsider can be daunting. Many people don’t know where to start, and the resources available can feel overwhelming or disconnected from real-world needs. Additionally, the recent changes in policy by the Trump administration have left many in the disability community feeling vulnerable and unprotected. At AccessiTech, I&#x27;m here to provide not just resources but also advocacy, ensuring that accessibility remains a priority in an ever-changing landscape.</p>
<h2>AccessiTech&#x27;s Services</h2>
<p>At AccessiTech, I offer <a href="https://www.accessi.tech/#consultation">a range of services</a> designed to make accessibility more approachable and actionable. Whether it’s through accessibility audits that identify barriers in your designs, design research that ensures inclusivity from the ground up, or project management that keeps accessibility at the forefront of development, I’m here to help you create products that truly work for everyone.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.accessi.tech/#qa">QA Engineer</a>, I also provide end-to-end quality assurance, ensuring that your software is not only functional but also accessible at every stage of the product lifecycle. And for those just starting their journey in web development, I offer <a href="https://www.accessi.tech/#mentorship">mentorship</a> to help dispel myths, overcome challenges, and instill best practices for creating accessible solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, through <a href="https://www.accessi.tech/#production">software production</a>, I am proud to create and promote free, modular, and robust open-source tools that make accessibility easier for developers and users alike. By providing these resources, we’re not just advocating for change—we’re actively building it.</p>
<h2>AccessiTech&#x27;s Dream</h2>
<p>I believe that accessibility is not just a technical requirement—it’s a moral imperative. By countering ableism in ICT communities and promoting inclusive design, we’re working toward a future where everyone, regardless of ability, can fully participate in the digital world. Together, we can create a world where accessibility is the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>If you’re as passionate about accessibility as I am, I’d love to hear from you. Whether you’re looking for consultation, mentorship, or just want to chat about how we can make the web a more inclusive place, feel free to reach out.
