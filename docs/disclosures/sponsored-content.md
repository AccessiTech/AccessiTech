# Sponsored Content Disclosure

At AccessiTech, we are dedicated to transparency, accessibility, and inclusion in all aspects of our work. This website may publish sponsored content to help support our mission of removing barriers and fostering equity for all.

- **Transparency:** All sponsored content is clearly labeled as "Sponsored" or similar, and is always distinguishable from editorial or independent content. Sponsorship does not influence our independent reviews, recommendations, or opinions.
- **Accessibility:** We require that all sponsored content meets or exceeds WCAG 2.1 AA standards and is accessible to everyone, including users of assistive technologies.
- **User Empowerment:** If you have questions, concerns, or encounter any accessibility barriers related to sponsored content, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AccessiTech/AccessiTech/issues) or email us at [accessit3ch@gmail.com](mailto:accessit3ch@gmail.com). Your feedback helps us improve.

We regularly review our sponsored content practices to ensure compliance with legal, ethical, and accessibility guidelines, and to maintain a positive, inclusive experience for all users. For more about our values and accessibility commitment, see our [Accessibility Statement](../../ACCESSIBILITY.md).
