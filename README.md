### Accessibility of this Website

Accessibility has been at the forefront of the design and development of this site. That being said, I am here to learn as much as I am to share, if not more so! If you notice something that makes this site inaccessible to you, that's a mismatch and I want to address it! If I'm doing something wrong our outdated, or if you have ideas of how to better implement accessibility in the design or development, let me know and we can find solutions together! While I'm doing everything I can upfront, I know that implementing web accessibility is an ongoing and iterative process, so please bear with me!
