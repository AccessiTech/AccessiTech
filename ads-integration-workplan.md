# EthicalAds Integration & Open Source Ad Package Workplan

## Phase 1: EthicalAds Integration

### 1. Register with EthicalAds

- Apply for an EthicalAds publisher account at https://ethicalads.io/publishers/.
- Complete the onboarding process and obtain your publisher key/ad code.

### 2. Plan Ad Placement

- Identify accessible, non-intrusive locations for ads (e.g., sidebar, below blog posts, footer).
- Ensure placements do not interfere with navigation or content.

### 3. Implement EthicalAds

- Add EthicalAds script and ad units to the codebase (React components or static HTML as needed).
- Clearly label ads as "Advertisement" per policy.
- Ensure ad containers are accessible (ARIA labels, focusable, keyboard navigation, etc.).

### 4. Accessibility & Privacy Review

- Test ad units with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Confirm no tracking cookies or behavioral targeting.
- Validate compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA and AccessiTech's [ads policy](public/disclosures/ads.md).

### 5. Documentation & Disclosure

- Update documentation to describe ad integration and user empowerment options.
- Link to [Advertisement Disclosure](public/disclosures/ads.md) from ad units if possible.

### 6. Feedback & Iteration

- Collect user feedback on ad accessibility and experience.
- Iterate on placement and implementation as needed.

## Phase 2: Open Source Ad Package (AdSense/Microsoft Ads)

### 1. Research & Requirements

- Review Google AdSense and Microsoft Ads integration requirements.
- Identify accessibility and privacy gaps in default implementations.

### 2. Design Package API

- Plan a React component or library API for ad integration.
- Features: clear labeling, ARIA support, consent management, ad-block fallback, privacy controls.

### 3. Build & Test

- Develop the package with accessibility and transparency as core principles.
- Test with real ad code (sandbox/test mode) and accessibility tools.

### 4. Documentation

- Provide clear usage instructions, accessibility notes, and privacy guidance.
- Open source the package (e.g., GitHub, npm).

### 5. Community Feedback

- Invite feedback and contributions from the accessibility and dev community.
