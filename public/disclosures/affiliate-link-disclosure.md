# Affiliate Link Disclosure

At AccessiTech, we are committed to transparency, accessibility, and inclusion. Some links on this site may be affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you make a purchase through these linksâ€”at no additional cost to you. Affiliate partnerships help support our mission to remove barriers and foster equity for all.

- **Transparency:** All affiliate links are clearly identified as such. Affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content, recommendations, or reviews in any way.
- **Accessibility:** We only recommend products and services that we believe are accessible and valuable to our users. We ensure all affiliate links meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards and are accessible to everyone, including users of assistive technologies.
- **User Empowerment:** If you have questions, concerns, or encounter any accessibility barriers related to affiliate links, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AccessiTech/AccessiTech/issues) or email us at [contact@accessitech.dev](mailto:contact@accessitech.dev). Your feedback helps us improve.

We regularly review our affiliate practices to ensure compliance with legal, ethical, and accessibility guidelines, and to maintain a positive, inclusive experience for all users. For more about our values and accessibility commitment, see our [Accessibility Statement](../../ACCESSIBILITY.md).
