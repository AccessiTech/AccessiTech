# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 7–8 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that text is readable for users with low vision.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Enhanced contrast helps users with more severe vision impairments.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Text with extremely high contrast (white on black, black on white)] -->

> "The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for large text, incidental text, or logotypes. Large text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1."

Guideline 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#contrast-enhanced).

- Normal text must have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 against its background.
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- Decorative or incidental text, and logos, are exempt.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Pie chart showing prevalence of low vision, icons for glasses, and a warning sign for poor contrast] -->

- **Accessibility:** Enhanced contrast helps users with severe vision impairments.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensures content is accessible to the widest possible audience.
- **Legal Compliance:** Contrast (Enhanced) is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** High contrast improves readability for everyone, especially in bright or low-light conditions.

For more, see the [W3C's Contrast Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G17).

## **What Needs to Support Enhanced Contrast?**

<!-- [Grid: Text, buttons, links, form fields, all with very high contrast examples] -->

- Body text and headings
- Buttons and links
- Form fields and labels
- Images of text
- Navigation menus

All must meet the enhanced contrast requirements for Level AAA.

## **How to Meet Guideline 1.4.6**

<!-- [Side-by-side: Button with 7:1 contrast vs. button with lower contrast] -->

- Use a contrast ratio checker to test text and background colors
- Ensure normal text is at least 7:1 contrast
- Large text (18pt/14pt bold) is at least 4.5:1
- Avoid using images of text unless necessary
- Test in different lighting conditions and with colorblind simulators

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with readable, high-contrast text, right side with faint, low-contrast text] -->

- Using colors that do not meet the 7:1 ratio for normal text
- Buttons or links with insufficient contrast
- Not testing with real users or tools

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 1.4.6 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** No minimum contrast requirement for text (see 1.4.1 for use of color).
- **Level AA:** Requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (see 1.4.3).
- **Level AAA:** Requires 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for text, buttons, links, and contrast checker] -->

- All text meets enhanced contrast ratios
- Large text meets reduced ratio
- No important info in images of text
- Tested with contrast checker tools

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User reading very high-contrast text on a web page] -->

Guideline 1.4.6 ensures text is readable for users with severe vision impairments. Use contrast checkers and always test your designs for the highest level of accessibility.

*Accessibility means everyone can read your message—aim for the highest contrast!*
