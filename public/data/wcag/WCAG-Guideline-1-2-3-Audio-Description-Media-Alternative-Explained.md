# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Video player with audio description and transcript overlay] -->

> "An audio description or a media alternative is provided for all prerecorded video content."

Guideline 1.2.3 is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded).

- Prerecorded video content must have an audio description or a full text alternative (media alternative).
- Audio descriptions narrate important visual information for users who are blind or have low vision.
- Media alternatives provide a complete text version of the video content.

This ensures everyone can access the information in your videos, regardless of vision ability.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.2 and referenced in accessibility laws worldwide.
- **Usability:** Media alternatives help users in situations where video can’t be watched.
