## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes informing users about timeouts and their impact on data or progress.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and information to complete tasks. Timeouts can cause users to lose data or progress if not properly communicated.
