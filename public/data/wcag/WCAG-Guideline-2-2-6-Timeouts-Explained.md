# **WCAG Guideline 2.2.6: Timeouts Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes informing users about timeouts and their impact on data or progress.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and information to complete tasks. Timeouts can cause users to lose data or progress if not properly communicated.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.6 Timeouts?**

[Illustration: Warning icon and a clock with a timeout message]

> "Users are warned about the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours of inactivity."

Guideline 2.2.6 Timeouts is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#timeouts).

- Users must be warned about session or activity timeouts that could cause data loss.
- Exception: if data is preserved for more than 20 hours of inactivity, no warning is required.
- Applies to forms, applications, and any activity with a timeout.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Accessibility:** Users with disabilities may need more time and are more likely to be interrupted.
- **Inclusivity:** Prevents frustration and loss of work for all users.
- **Legal Compliance:** Timeouts is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Improves user experience by preventing unexpected data loss.
