## **Guideline 4: Robust**

The Robust principle ensures that web content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## **Guideline 4.1: Compatible**

Guideline 4.1 focuses on making sure content can be reliably interpreted by a wide range of technologies.

## **What Is Guideline 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value?**

<!-- [Illustration: Code showing ARIA attributes for a button] -->

> "For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes is available to user agents."

Guideline 4.1.2 requires that all interactive elements are accessible to assistive technologies by exposing their name, role, and value.

- Ensures UI components are usable with screen readers and other assistive tech
- Essential for accessible forms, buttons, and custom widgets
- Applies to all interactive elements, including those generated by scripts

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Name, role, and value help assistive technologies interpret UI components.
- **Legal Compliance:** Name, Role, Value is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents errors and improves accessibility for all users.

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 4.1.2 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** Requires name, role, and value can be programmatically determined. This is the core requirement for 4.1.2 and is mandatory for basic accessibility.
- **Level AA:** For Guideline 4.1.2, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AA.
- **Level AAA:** For Guideline 4.1.2, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AAA.
