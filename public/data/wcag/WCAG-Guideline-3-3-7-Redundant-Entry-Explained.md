# **WCAG Guideline 3.3.7: Redundant Entry Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

---

## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that users can easily interact with and understand web content, especially when entering information.

## **Guideline 3.3: Input Assistance**

Guideline 3.3 focuses on helping users avoid and correct mistakes when entering information, including reducing unnecessary repetition.

## **What Is Guideline 3.3.7 Redundant Entry?**

<!-- [Illustration: Form with auto-filled fields and a user icon] -->

> "Information previously entered by or provided to the user is either auto-populated or available for the user to select."

Guideline 3.3.7 requires that users are not forced to re-enter the same information multiple times in a single process.

- Helps users complete forms more efficiently
- Essential for users with cognitive, mobility, or learning disabilities
- Applies to all multi-step forms and processes

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Auto-fill icon, user with assistive tech, and form fields] -->

- **All Users:** Benefit from reduced repetition and effort
- **Users with Disabilities:** May find repeated entry especially challenging
- **Accessibility:** Improves efficiency and reduces frustration

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on Redundant Entry](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html).

## **What Needs to Avoid Redundant Entry?**

<!-- [Grid: Multi-step forms, checkout processes, and registration flows] -->

- Multi-step forms (e.g., checkout, registration)
- Any process requiring repeated information
- Auto-populate or allow selection of previously entered data

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.3.7**

<!-- [Side-by-side: Good example (auto-filled fields) vs. Bad example (user re-entering info)] -->

- Auto-populate fields with previously entered information
- Allow users to select from previously provided data
- Test multi-step processes for redundant entry

For more, see the [W3C's Redundant Entry Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G211).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with auto-filled fields, right side with repeated entry] -->

- Forcing users to re-enter the same information
- Not providing auto-fill or selection options
- Failing to test multi-step forms for redundancy

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.3.7 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level AA:** Requires redundant entry to be avoided in multi-step processes.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 3.3.7.
- **Level A:** Not applicable (3.3.7 is a Level AA requirement).

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 3.3.7 Redundant Entry](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for auto-fill, user, and form fields] -->

- Fields are auto-populated or selectable if previously entered
- No repeated entry required in multi-step forms
- Tested for redundancy with assistive technology

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User completing a form with auto-filled fields] -->

Guideline 3.3.7 ensures that users don’t have to enter the same information more than once in a process. Reduce repetition for a smoother, more accessible experience.
