**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes letting users continue their work after re-authenticating, such as after a session timeout.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and flexibility to complete tasks. Re-authenticating ensures users don’t lose their work if they need to log in again.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.5 Re-authenticating?**

> "When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating."

Guideline 2.2.5 Re-authenticating is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#re-authenticating).

- Users must be able to continue their activity after logging back in, without losing data.
- Applies to forms, shopping carts, and any activity interrupted by session timeouts.
- Supports users who need more time or are interrupted during tasks.

This ensures users can continue their activities without losing data, even if they need to re-authenticate.
