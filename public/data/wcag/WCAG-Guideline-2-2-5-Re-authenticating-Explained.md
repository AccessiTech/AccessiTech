# **WCAG Guideline 2.2.5: Re-authenticating Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes letting users continue their work after re-authenticating, such as after a session timeout.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and flexibility to complete tasks. Re-authenticating ensures users don’t lose their work if they need to log in again.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.5 Re-authenticating?**

<!-- [Illustration: User re-authenticating and continuing a session without data loss] -->

> "When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity without loss of data after re-authenticating."

Guideline 2.2.5 Re-authenticating is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#re-authenticating).

- Users must be able to continue their activity after logging back in, without losing data.
- Applies to forms, shopping carts, and any activity interrupted by session timeouts.
- Supports users who need more time or are interrupted during tasks.

This ensures users can continue their activities without losing data, even if they need to re-authenticate.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: User re-authenticating, session icon, and data preserved] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Session timeouts can cause data loss for users who need more time.
- **Legal Compliance:** Re-authenticating is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents frustration and loss of work for all users.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on session timeouts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/re-authenticating.html).

## **What Needs to Support Re-authenticating?**

<!-- [Grid: Forms, checkouts, applications, all with session icons] -->

- Online forms and checkouts
- Applications with session timeouts
- Any feature requiring authentication

All must allow users to continue without loss of data after logging back in.

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User resuming a session after re-authenticating] -->

Guideline 2.2.5 is essential for preventing data loss and supporting users who need more time. By preserving user data during re-authentication, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Test your site regularly and make session management a core part of your development process.
