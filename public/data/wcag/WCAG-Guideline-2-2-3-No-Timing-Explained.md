## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes removing unnecessary time constraints that could prevent users from completing tasks.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time to complete tasks. No Timing is the strictest standard, requiring that content does not impose any time limits at all.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.3 No Timing?**

> "Timing is not an essential part of the event or activity presented by the content, except for non-interactive synchronized media and real-time events."

Guideline 2.2.3 No Timing is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#no-timing).

- Content must not require users to complete tasks within a set time limit.
- Exceptions: real-time events and non-interactive synchronized media (like live video).
- Applies to forms, quizzes, games, and any interactive content.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Some users need more time due to mobility, cognitive, or reading disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance:** No Timing is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Removes stress and errors for all users, especially in forms and tests.
