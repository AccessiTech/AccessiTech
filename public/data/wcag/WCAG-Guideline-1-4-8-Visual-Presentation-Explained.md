# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.8: Visual Presentation Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–9 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes giving users control over how text is visually presented.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Visual Presentation is about letting users adjust text display to suit their needs.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.8 Visual Presentation?**

<!-- [Illustration: Settings panel with sliders for text size, color, and line spacing] -->

> "For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to achieve the following: foreground and background colors can be selected by the user; width is no more than 80 characters; text is not justified; line spacing is at least 1.5 within paragraphs; spacing between paragraphs is at least 1.5 times the line spacing; and text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200%."

Guideline 1.4.8 Visual Presentation is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#visual-presentation).

- Users must be able to control text color, background, width, spacing, and resizing.
- Applies to blocks of text, not single words or short labels.
- Supports users with low vision, dyslexia, and other reading difficulties.
