## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes protecting users from content that could cause physical harm, such as seizures.

## **Guideline 2.3: Seizures and Physical Reactions**

Guideline 2.3 focuses on preventing content that could trigger seizures or other physical reactions, especially from flashing or strobing effects.

## **What Is Guideline 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold?**

<!-- [Illustration: Warning icon and a screen with a flashing animation crossed out] -->

> "Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds."

Guideline 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold).

- Content must not flash more than three times per second, unless it is below the defined thresholds for general and red flashes.
- Applies to videos, animations, banners, and any visual content.
- Protects users with photosensitive epilepsy and similar conditions.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: User with epilepsy, warning icon, and safe animation] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Flashing content can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.
- **Legal Compliance:** Three Flashes or Below Threshold is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents discomfort and health risks for all users.

## **How to Avoid Flashing Content**

<!-- [Side-by-side code snippets: Safe animation, unsafe animation]
[Example: Settings panel for animation control] -->

- Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second
- Use safe animation techniques
- Test with users who are sensitive to flashing
- Document animation policies

For more, see the [W3C's Three Flashes Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G19).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with safe animation, right side with unsafe animation] -->

- Content that flashes more than three times per second
- No warning about flashing content
- Not documenting animation policies
- Not testing with users who are sensitive to flashing

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 2.3.1 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** Requires content does not flash more than three times per second or is below the threshold. This is the core requirement for 2.3.1 and is mandatory for basic accessibility.
- **Level AA:** For Guideline 2.3.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AA.
- **Level AAA:** For Guideline 2.3.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AAA.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for each item (no flash, warning, safe animation, etc.)] -->

- No content flashes more than three times per second
- All animations are safe for users with epilepsy
- Animation policies are documented
- Tested with users who are sensitive to flashing

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User enjoying safe animation on a web app] -->

Guideline 2.3.1 is essential for preventing seizures and supporting users with photosensitive epilepsy. By avoiding flashing content, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Test your site regularly and make safe animation a core part of your development process.
