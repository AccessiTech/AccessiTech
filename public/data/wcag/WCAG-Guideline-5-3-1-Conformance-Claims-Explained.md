## **What Is a WCAG Conformance Claim?**

A conformance claim is a public statement that a web page, site, or application meets the requirements of a specific version and level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Section 5.3.1 of WCAG 2.1 defines exactly what must be included in such a claim for it to be valid.

## **Required Components of a Conformance Claim**

To make a valid conformance claim under WCAG 2.1, you must include all of the following:

1. **Date of the claim** – When the claim is made.
2. **Guidelines title, version, and URI** – For example: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
3. **Conformance level satisfied** – Level A, AA, or AAA.
4. **A concise description of the web pages covered by the claim** – This can be a list of URIs or an expression that describes all included pages (such as a pattern or domain).
5. **A list of web content technologies relied upon** – All technologies (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PDF, etc.) that are required for the content to meet WCAG.

**Note:** If a conformance logo is used, it counts as a claim and must be accompanied by all required components.

## **Best Practices for Conformance Claims**

- Be specific and clear about the scope (which pages, domains, or resources are covered).
- List only technologies that are essential for accessibility (not just present on the site).
- Keep the claim up to date—review and update after significant changes.
- Optionally, provide contact information for feedback or questions.
