# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)?**

> "For prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, an alternative is provided."

Guideline 1.2.1 is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded).

- Prerecorded audio-only content (like podcasts) must have a transcript.
- Prerecorded video-only content (like silent animations) must have an equivalent text or audio description.
- These alternatives ensure users who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or have low vision can access the information.

This means that everyone, regardless of sensory ability, can understand the content of your media.

---

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Inclusivity:** Transcripts and descriptions make media accessible to users with hearing or vision disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.2 and referenced in accessibility laws worldwide.
- **Usability:** Alternatives help users in noisy or quiet environments, or when media can’t be played aloud.

## **What Needs Alternatives?**

- Prerecorded audio-only content (podcasts, interviews)
- Prerecorded video-only content (silent animations, instructional videos without sound)

All such media must have a text transcript or audio description that conveys the same information.

---

## **How to Provide Alternatives**

- Provide a text transcript for all prerecorded audio-only content
- Provide a text or audio description for all prerecorded video-only content
- Make transcripts and descriptions easy to find and use
- Ensure alternatives are accurate and complete

For more, see the [W3C's media alternatives docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded.html).

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- No transcript for audio-only content
- No description for video-only content
- Alternatives that are incomplete or inaccurate
- Hiding transcripts or descriptions from users

Audit your site regularly and use accessibility checkers to ensure all media has proper alternatives. For more, see [WebAIM's guide to captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions](https://webaim.org/techniques/captions/), which covers best practices for making audio and video content accessible.

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 1.2.1 in WCAG 2.2**

- **Level A:** Requires alternatives for prerecorded audio-only and video-only content. This is the core requirement for 1.2.1 and is mandatory for basic accessibility.
- **Level AA:** For Guideline 1.2.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AA.
- **Level AAA:** For Guideline 1.2.1, there are no additional requirements beyond Level A in WCAG 2.2. Meeting Level A for this guideline also satisfies Level AAA.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded.html).

---

## **Quick Checklist**

- All prerecorded audio-only content has a transcript
- All prerecorded video-only content has a text or audio description
- Alternatives are accurate and complete
- Transcripts and descriptions are easy to find
- Tested with users and assistive technology

## **Summary**

Guideline 1.2.1 is essential for making media content accessible to everyone. By providing transcripts and descriptions, you support users with disabilities, improve usability, and meet legal requirements. Make media alternatives a standard part of your content process.
