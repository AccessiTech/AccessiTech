# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.7: Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Video player with audio description enabled] -->

> "Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media."

Guideline 1.2.7 is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#extended-audio-description-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded video content with audio should have extended audio description if standard audio description is not sufficient.
- Extended audio description provides additional narration during pauses to describe important visual details.
- This is especially important for complex or fast-paced videos where standard audio description can't keep up.

This ensures that users who are blind or have low vision can fully understand your video content.
