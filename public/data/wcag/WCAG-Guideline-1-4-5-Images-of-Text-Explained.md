# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.5: Images of Text Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that text is real and not just an image.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Real text can be resized, read by screen readers, and adapted to user needs—images of text cannot.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.5 Images of Text?**

> "If the same visual presentation can be made using text alone, an image of text is used only for pure decoration or where a particular presentation of text is essential."

Guideline 1.4.5 Images of Text is a requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#images-of-text).

- Use real text instead of images of text whenever possible.
- Images of text are allowed only for decoration or when a specific style is essential (e.g., logos).
- Real text is more accessible, flexible, and adaptable.
