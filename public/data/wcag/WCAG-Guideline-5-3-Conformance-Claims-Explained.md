## **What Is a Conformance Claim?**

<!-- [Illustration: Certificate or checklist with accessibility icons] -->

A conformance claim is a public statement that a web page, site, or application meets the requirements of a specific WCAG version and level. It documents the scope, methods, and results of accessibility evaluation.

- Helps organizations demonstrate accessibility efforts
- Provides transparency for users and stakeholders
- Can be used for legal, procurement, or policy purposes

## **5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim**

To make a valid conformance claim, the following components are required:

- **Date of the claim**
- **Guidelines title, version, and URI** (e.g., WCAG 2.2, https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/)
- **Conformance level claimed** (A, AA, or AAA)
- **Web page(s) or resource(s) covered by the claim**
- **Scope of the claim** (entire site, specific pages, etc.)
- **Accessibility support baseline** (technologies relied upon)
