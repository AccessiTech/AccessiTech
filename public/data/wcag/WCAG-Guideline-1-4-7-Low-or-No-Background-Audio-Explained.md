# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.7: Low or No Background Audio Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that speech audio is clear and not obscured by background sounds.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. For audio, this means ensuring speech is not masked by music or other sounds.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio?**

<!-- [Illustration: Speaker icon with a music note faded behind a clear speech bubble] -->

> "For prerecorded audio-only content that contains primarily speech, background sounds are either at least 20 decibels lower than the speech content, can be turned off, or are not present."

Guideline 1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#low-or-no-background-audio).

- Speech must be clearly distinguishable from background sounds.
- Background audio must be at least 20 dB lower than speech, be removable, or not present.
- Applies to prerecorded audio-only content (e.g., podcasts, lectures).

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Clarity:** Background sounds can make speech hard to understand, especially for users with hearing loss.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensures everyone can access spoken content.
- **Legal Compliance:** Low or No Background Audio is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Clear audio benefits all users, especially in noisy environments.
