## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes helping users quickly reach the main content by skipping repetitive navigation or blocks.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Bypass Blocks is about providing shortcuts to skip over repeated elements.
