# **WCAG Guideline 5.7: Security Considerations Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

---

## **Guideline 5: Emerging Technologies**

The Emerging Technologies principle ensures that new and evolving web technologies are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## **Guideline 5.7: Security Considerations**

Guideline 5.7 emphasizes the importance of protecting users from security risks in accessible digital experiences, especially as new technologies introduce novel threats.

## **What Are Security Considerations in Accessibility?**

Security considerations refer to the practices and safeguards that protect users from threats such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks when using accessible technologies and content.

- Ensures users’ data and interactions are protected
- Prevents exploitation of accessibility features for attacks
- Builds trust with users, especially those with disabilities who may be more vulnerable to security risks

---

## **Why Does This Matter?**

- **Vulnerable Populations:** People with disabilities may rely on assistive technologies that could be targeted
- **Trust:** Users are more likely to engage with accessible content if it is secure
- **Legal/Policy:** Security breaches can have legal and reputational consequences
- **Ethics:** Protecting security is a core part of inclusive design

---

## **What Needs to Be Addressed?**

- Identify potential security risks in accessible features
- Ensure authentication and authorization processes are accessible and secure
- Protect user data during input, storage, and transmission
- Regularly test for vulnerabilities, especially in accessibility-related code
- Educate users about secure practices

---

## **How to Address Security Considerations**

<!-- [Infographic: Security dashboard with accessibility features] -->

- Conduct security assessments for new features
- Use security-by-design principles in development
- Make authentication methods accessible (e.g., CAPTCHAs with alternatives)
- Minimize data exposure and use encryption
- Regularly update and patch systems

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Using inaccessible security features (e.g., visual-only CAPTCHAs)
- Failing to test accessibility features for security vulnerabilities
- Overlooking security in third-party integrations
- Not updating security practices as technology evolves

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA (WCAG 2.2)**

- Security considerations are important at all conformance levels
- Higher levels may require more robust security controls and transparency
- The goal is to ensure security is not compromised for accessibility, and vice versa

---

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Shield, padlock, and dashboard icons] -->

- Security risks in accessible features identified and addressed
- Authentication is both secure and accessible
- User data is protected at all stages
- Security practices are reviewed and updated regularly

---

## **Summary**

<!-- [Illustration: User interacting with a secure, accessible website] -->

Security is essential for all users, including those with disabilities. By addressing security considerations in accessible design, you protect users, comply with laws, and create safer, more inclusive digital experiences.

*Accessibility and security go hand in hand—protect both for every user!*
