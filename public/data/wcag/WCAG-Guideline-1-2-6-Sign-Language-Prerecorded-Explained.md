# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.6: Sign Language (Prerecorded) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Video player with a sign language interpreter overlay] -->

> "Sign language interpretation is provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media."

Guideline 1.2.6 is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#sign-language-prerecorded).

- All prerecorded video content with audio should have a sign language interpretation track or overlay.
- Sign language interpretation makes content accessible to users who are deaf and use sign language as their primary means of communication.
- This is especially important for educational, governmental, and public service content.

This ensures that users who rely on sign language can fully understand your video content.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Video player, sign language interpreter, and user with hearing aid] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Sign language interpretation provides access for users who are deaf and use sign language.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Enhances understanding for users who prefer sign language over written captions.

## **What Needs Sign Language Interpretation?**

<!-- [Grid: Video player, webinar, online course, all with sign language overlay] -->

- Prerecorded video content with audio (webinars, tutorials, online courses)
- Any synchronized media with spoken content

All such media should have sign language interpretation available.

## **How to Provide Sign Language Interpretation**

<!-- [Side-by-side: Video with sign language overlay, video without]
[Example: Video player with sign language toggle] -->

- Record or embed a sign language interpreter in the video
- Offer a separate sign language track or overlay
- Make the sign language option easy to enable and view
- Ensure interpretation is accurate and synchronized

For more, see [W3C's sign language docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sign-language-prerecorded.html).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with clear sign language overlay, right side with missing or unclear interpretation] -->

- No sign language interpretation for video content
- Interpretation that is out of sync or hard to see
- Not making the sign language option easy to find
- Using unqualified interpreters

Audit your site regularly and use accessibility checkers to ensure all video content has proper sign language interpretation. For more, see [ADA.gov's Effective Communication guidance](https://www.ada.gov/resources/effective-communication/).
