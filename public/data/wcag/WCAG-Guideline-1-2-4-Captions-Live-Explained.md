# **WCAG Guideline 1.2.4: Captions (Live) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 8–10 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The first principle of WCAG, Perceivable, ensures that information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. This means content can’t be invisible to all of a user’s senses—whether they are seeing, hearing, or feeling the content through assistive technology.

## **Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media**

Guideline 1.2 focuses on making time-based media—like audio and video—accessible to everyone. This includes providing alternatives such as transcripts, captions, and audio descriptions so users with different abilities can access the content.

## **What Is Guideline 1.2.4 Captions (Live)?**

<!-- [Illustration: Live video player with captions enabled] -->

> "Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media."

Guideline 1.2.4 is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#captions-live).

- All live video content with audio must have captions.
- Captions should accurately reflect spoken dialogue and important sounds in real time.
- Captions help users who are deaf, hard of hearing, or in environments where audio can’t be played.

This ensures everyone can access the information in your live videos, regardless of hearing ability or environment.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Live video player, captions, user with hearing aid] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Captions make live video content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing.
- **Legal Compliance:** This is a Level AA requirement in WCAG 2.2 and referenced in accessibility laws worldwide.
- **Usability:** Captions help all users in noisy or quiet environments, or when audio is muted.

- Use live captioning services or software to create real-time captions
- Ensure captions are as accurate and timely as possible
- Include speaker identification and important non-speech sounds
- Make captions easy to enable and access

For more, see the [W3C's captions docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-live.html).
