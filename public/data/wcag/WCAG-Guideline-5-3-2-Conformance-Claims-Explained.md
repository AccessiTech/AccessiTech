## **What Are Optional Components of a Conformance Claim?**

Section 5.3.2 of WCAG 2.1 lists additional information you can include in a conformance claim to help users, clients, and regulators better understand your accessibility status. These components are not required, but are recommended for greater transparency and clarity.

## **Recommended Optional Components**

Consider including the following in your conformance claim:

- **Success criteria beyond the claimed level that have been met** (e.g., if you meet some AAA criteria but claim AA)
- **Technologies used but not relied upon** (features present but not required for accessibility)
- **User agents and assistive technologies used for testing**
- **Specific accessibility characteristics of the content** (such as ARIA usage, keyboard navigation, etc.)
- **Any additional steps taken to enhance accessibility beyond WCAG requirements**
- **Machine-readable metadata** for technologies relied upon and the conformance claim itself
- **Contact information for accessibility feedback**
- **Date of last review or update**

---

## **Why Include Optional Components?**

- **Transparency:** Helps users understand the scope and limitations of your claim
- **Clarity:** Makes it easier for others to evaluate your accessibility status
- **Continuous improvement:** Encourages regular review and updates
- **Legal and procurement:** May be helpful for contracts or compliance
