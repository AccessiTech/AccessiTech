# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 7–8 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that additional content (like tooltips or popups) is accessible when triggered by hover or focus.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Content on Hover or Focus ensures that popups, tooltips, and similar elements are usable by everyone.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus?**

> "Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true: the content can be dismissed, remains visible while hovered or focused, and is accessible."

Guideline 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#content-on-hover-or-focus).

- Additional content (tooltips, popups) must be dismissible, hoverable, and persistent while focused.
- Applies to any content that appears on hover or focus, not just tooltips.
- Ensures all users can access, read, and dismiss popups.
