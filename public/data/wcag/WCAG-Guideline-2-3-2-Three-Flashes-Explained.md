Guideline 2.3.2 Three Flashes is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#three-flashes).

- Content must not flash more than three times per second, with no exceptions for thresholds.
- Applies to videos, animations, banners, and any visual content.
- This is the strictest standard for flashing content.
