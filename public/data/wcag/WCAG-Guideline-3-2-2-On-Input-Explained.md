# **WCAG Guideline 3.2.2: On Input Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

---

## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that web content behaves in ways users expect, especially when interacting with forms and controls.

## **Guideline 3.2: Predictable**

Guideline 3.2 focuses on making web pages behave in ways users expect, especially when interacting with forms, links, and controls.

## **What Is Guideline 3.2.2 On Input?**

<!-- [Illustration: Form with input fields and a submit button, no automatic navigation] -->

> "Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component."

Guideline 3.2.2 requires that changes in input (like selecting an option or entering text) do not trigger unexpected actions such as navigation or content changes, unless users are warned in advance.

- Prevents confusion for users, especially those using assistive technology
- Ensures users are in control of their experience
- Applies to all form controls, dropdowns, and interactive widgets

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: Form field, warning icon, and user with assistive tech] -->

- **Keyboard and Screen Reader Users:** May be disoriented by unexpected changes after input
- **All Users:** Predictable behavior builds trust and usability
- **Accessibility:** Users need to know what will happen before it happens

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input.html).

## **What Needs to Avoid Changes on Input?**

<!-- [Grid: Dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields] -->

- All form controls (dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields)
- Avoid triggering navigation, popups, or content changes on input alone
- If a change is necessary, provide a clear warning or instruction

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.2.2**

<!-- [Side-by-side: Good example (submit button required) vs. Bad example (dropdown triggers navigation)] -->

- Require explicit user action (e.g., clicking a submit button) to trigger changes
- Warn users if a control will cause a change of context on input
- Test all form controls for unexpected behavior
- Review custom widgets for input-triggered changes

For more, see the [W3C's On Input Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G201).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

<!-- [Do/Don't graphic: Left side with submit button, right side with dropdown causing navigation] -->

- Triggering navigation or popups when a user changes a form control
- Failing to warn users about input-triggered changes
- Not testing with keyboard and assistive technology

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.2.2 in WCAG 2.2**

<!-- [Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each] -->

- **Level A:** Requires no change of context on input unless users are warned.
- **Level AA:** No additional requirements for 3.2.2.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 3.2.2.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 3.2.2 On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

<!-- [Checklist graphic: Icons for form, warning, and submit button] -->

- No navigation or popups triggered by input alone
- All changes require explicit user action or clear warning
- Tested with keyboard and assistive technology
- Custom widgets reviewed for input behavior
