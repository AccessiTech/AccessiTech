**Estimated read time:** 6–7 minutes

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure users can always see which element is focused when navigating with a keyboard.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Focus Visible is about ensuring a visible indicator is present when elements receive keyboard focus.

## **What Is Guideline 2.4.7 Focus Visible?**

> "Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible."

Guideline 2.4.7 Focus Visible is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#focus-visible).

- All interactive elements must show a visible focus indicator when navigated to by keyboard.
- Applies to links, buttons, form fields, menus, and any focusable content.
- The focus indicator must be clearly visible and not removed by custom styles.

This ensures all users can see which element is focused, supporting navigation and accessibility for everyone.
