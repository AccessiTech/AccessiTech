## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure users can always see which element is focused when navigating with a keyboard.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Focus Visible is about ensuring a visible indicator is present when elements receive keyboard focus.

## **What Is Guideline 2.4.7 Focus Visible?**
