Guideline 2.5 focuses on making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods, including speech, touch, and keyboard.

## **What Is Guideline 2.5.3 Label in Name?**

> "For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the accessible name contains the visible label text."

Guideline 2.5.3 Label in Name is a Level A requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#label-in-name).

- The accessible name (used by screen readers and speech input) must match the visible label.
- Applies to buttons, links, form fields, and any labeled UI component.
- Supports users who use speech input or screen readers.

This ensures all components have accessible names that match visible labels, supporting clarity and usability for everyone.
