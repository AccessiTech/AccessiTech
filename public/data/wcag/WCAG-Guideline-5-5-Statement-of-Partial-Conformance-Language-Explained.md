# **WCAG Guideline 5.5: Statement of Partial Conformance – Language Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

---

## **Guideline 5: Emerging Technologies**

The Emerging Technologies principle ensures that new and evolving web technologies are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## **Guideline 5.5: Statement of Partial Conformance – Language**

Guideline 5.5 addresses situations where full accessibility conformance cannot be achieved due to limitations in language support—such as when assistive technologies or accessibility features are not available for certain languages.

## **What Is a Statement of Partial Conformance – Language?**

[Illustration: Globe with language icons and accessibility symbols]

A Statement of Partial Conformance – Language is a public declaration that a web page or resource would conform to WCAG, except for issues caused by the lack of accessibility support in a specific language.

- Used when some content is inaccessible solely because of language limitations
- Helps set realistic expectations for users and stakeholders
- Promotes transparency about accessibility efforts

---

## **Why Does This Matter?**

- **Global Inclusion:** Not all languages have equal support in assistive technologies
- **Transparency:** Users know which parts may not be fully accessible
- **Continuous Improvement:** Encourages tracking and addressing language gaps
- **Legal/Policy:** May be required for compliance or procurement

---

## **What Needs to Be Addressed?**

- Identify content that is inaccessible due to language limitations
- Document which languages are affected and why
- Ensure all other accessibility requirements are met
- Clearly communicate the scope and reason for partial conformance

---

## **How to Make a Statement of Partial Conformance – Language**

[Infographic: Document with highlighted language sections]

- Evaluate your content for accessibility in all supported languages
- If a language lacks accessibility support, document:
  - The affected language(s)
  - The reason for partial conformance (e.g., no screen reader support)
  - The scope (which pages/resources are affected)
- Publish the statement alongside your accessibility documentation
- Update the statement as language support improves

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Not specifying which languages are affected
- Failing to update the statement as support changes
- Using partial conformance as an excuse for avoidable issues
- Omitting the reason for partial conformance

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA (WCAG 2.2)**

- The process for making a Statement of Partial Conformance – Language is the same at all conformance levels (A, AA, AAA)
- The statement must clearly indicate that the only reason for non-conformance is language support
- All other accessibility requirements must be met for the unaffected content

---

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Globe, language icons, and document]

- Identified inaccessible content due to language
- Statement includes affected languages and reasons
- Scope and limitations are clear
- Statement is published and kept up to date

---

## **Summary**

A Statement of Partial Conformance – Language helps organizations be transparent about accessibility limitations caused by language support gaps. Clearly document which languages are affected, why, and what you’re doing to address these issues. Keep your statement current as technology evolves.
