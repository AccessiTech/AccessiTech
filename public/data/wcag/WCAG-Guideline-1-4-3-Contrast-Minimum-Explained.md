# **WCAG Guideline 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 7–8 minutes

---

## **Guideline 1: Perceivable**

The Perceivable principle ensures that all users can access and understand content, regardless of their sensory abilities. This includes making sure that text is readable against its background.

## **Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable**

Guideline 1.4 focuses on making content easier to see and hear. Sufficient contrast between text and background is essential for readability, especially for users with low vision or color blindness.

## **What Is Guideline 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)?**

> "The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large text, incidental text, or logotypes."

Guideline 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) is a requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#contrast-minimum).

- Normal text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.
- Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
- Decorative or incidental text, and logos, are exempt.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **Readability:** Low contrast makes text hard to read for everyone, especially those with low vision or color blindness.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensures content is accessible to a wider audience.
- **Legal Compliance:** Contrast (Minimum) is a Level AA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Good contrast improves user experience for all.

- Body text and headings
- Buttons and links
- Form fields and labels
- Images of text
- Navigation menus

All must meet the minimum contrast requirements.

## **How to Meet Guideline 1.4.3**

[Side-by-side: Button with sufficient contrast vs. button with low contrast]

- Use a contrast ratio checker to test text and background colors
- Ensure normal text is at least 4.5:1 contrast
- Large text (18pt/14pt bold) is at least 3:1
- Avoid using images of text unless necessary
- Test in different lighting conditions and with colorblind simulators

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Using light gray text on white backgrounds
- Buttons or links with insufficient contrast
- Relying on color alone for emphasis
- Not testing with real users or tools

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 1.4.3 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A:** No minimum contrast requirement for text (but see 1.4.1 for use of color).
- **Level AA:** Requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.
- **Level AAA:** Requires 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text (see 1.4.6).

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).
