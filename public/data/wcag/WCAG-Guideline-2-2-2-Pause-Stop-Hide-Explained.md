## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes giving users control over moving, blinking, or auto-updating content that can be distracting or inaccessible.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and control over content that changes or moves. This is especially important for users with cognitive or visual disabilities.
