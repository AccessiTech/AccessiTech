## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure interactive elements are large enough to tap or click easily.

## **Guideline 2.5: Input Modalities**

Guideline 2.5 focuses on making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods, including touch, mouse, and stylus.

## **What Is Guideline 2.5.5 Target Size?**

<!-- [Illustration: User tapping a large button on a touchscreen] -->

> "The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except where the target is duplicated, inline, or essential."

Guideline 2.5.5 Target Size is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#target-size).

- All interactive elements (buttons, links, controls) should be at least 44x44 CSS pixels.
- Exceptions: duplicate targets, inline links, browser controls, or essential small targets.
- Ensures users with limited dexterity or large fingers can easily activate controls.

This ensures all interactive elements are large enough for everyone to use comfortably and accurately.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

<!-- [Infographic: User with large finger, touch target, and accessibility icon] -->

- **Inclusivity:** Small targets are hard to hit for users with limited dexterity or larger fingers.
- **Legal Compliance:** Target Size is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
- **Usability:** Prevents accidental taps and improves user experience.

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size.html).
