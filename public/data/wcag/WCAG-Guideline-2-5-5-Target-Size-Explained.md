## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes making sure interactive elements are large enough to tap or click easily.

## **Guideline 2.5: Input Modalities**

Guideline 2.5 focuses on making it easier for users to operate functionality through various input methods, including touch, mouse, and stylus.

## **What Is Guideline 2.5.5 Target Size?**

> "The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels, except where the target is duplicated, inline, user agent controlled, or essential."

Guideline 2.5.5 Target Size is a Level AAA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#target-size).

- All interactive elements (buttons, links, controls) should be at least 44x44 CSS pixels.
- Exceptions: duplicate targets, inline links, browser controls, or essential small targets.
- Ensures users with limited dexterity or large fingers can easily activate controls.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: User with mobility aids, finger tapping a button, and target size icons]

- **Accessibility:** Small targets are hard to tap for users with limited dexterity or on mobile devices.
- **Inclusivity:** Supports users with motor impairments or large fingers.
- **Legal Compliance:** Target Size is a Level AAA requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Reduces frustration and errors for all users.

## **How to Meet Guideline 2.5.5**

[Side-by-side: Button with large tap area vs. button with small tap area]

- Ensure all interactive elements are at least 44x44 CSS pixels
- Add padding or spacing to increase target size
- Avoid placing small targets close together
- Test with users on touch devices and with limited dexterity
