## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that users can easily interact with and understand web content, especially when authenticating or logging in.

## **Guideline 3.3: Input Assistance**

Guideline 3.3 focuses on helping users avoid and correct mistakes when entering information, including during authentication.

## **What Is Guideline 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)?**

[Illustration: Login form with multiple accessible options and a user icon]

> "For each step in an authentication process, at least one method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test or the ability to transcribe information, unless an alternative is provided."

Guideline 3.3.9 builds on 3.3.8 by requiring that authentication does not depend on cognitive function tests or transcription (e.g., copying codes), unless an accessible alternative is available.

- Helps users with cognitive, memory, or motor disabilities
- Essential for fully accessible login and authentication
- Applies to all authentication steps and methods

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Login icon, user with assistive tech, and accessible options]

- **All Users:** May struggle with memory, puzzles, or transcription
- **Users with Disabilities:** Need alternatives to copying or solving puzzles
- **Accessibility:** Ensures everyone can log in or authenticate

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.3.9**

[Side-by-side: Good example (biometric, email link) vs. Bad example (copying codes, puzzles)]

- Provide alternatives to cognitive and transcription-based authentication (e.g., biometrics, email links)
- Avoid requiring users to copy, transcribe, or solve puzzles
- Test authentication with users with cognitive and motor disabilities

For more, see the [W3C's Accessible Authentication (Enhanced) Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G219).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with accessible login, right side with copying or puzzles]

- Requiring only cognitive or transcription-based authentication
- Not providing accessible alternatives
- Blocking password managers or copy-paste

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.3.9 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level AAA:** Requires authentication without cognitive or transcription barriers.
- **Level AA:** Not applicable (3.3.9 is a Level AAA requirement).
- **Level A:** Not applicable (3.3.9 is a Level AAA requirement).
