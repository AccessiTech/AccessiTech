# **WCAG Guideline 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 7–8 minutes

---

## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes giving users enough time to read and use content, especially when time limits are involved.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time to complete tasks. Time limits can create barriers for people with disabilities, so flexibility is essential.

## **What Is Guideline 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable?**

[Illustration: Clock icon with pause and extend buttons]

> "For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: the user can turn off, adjust, or extend the time limit, except where the time limit is essential, required for real-time events, or part of an activity with a time limit that is longer than 20 hours."

Guideline 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable is a requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#timing-adjustable).

- Users must be able to turn off, adjust, or extend any time limits set by the website or app.
- Exceptions: time limits that are essential, required for real-time events, or longer than 20 hours.
- Applies to forms, quizzes, logins, and any interactive content with a timer.

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: User with mobility aids, clock, and warning sign for time limits]

- **Inclusivity:** Some users need more time due to mobility, cognitive, or reading disabilities.
- **Legal Compliance:** Timing Adjustable is a Level A requirement in WCAG 2.2.
- **Usability:** Reduces stress and errors for all users, especially in forms and tests.

## **What Needs to Support Adjustable Timing?**

[Grid: Online forms, quizzes, checkout processes, all with visible time controls]
