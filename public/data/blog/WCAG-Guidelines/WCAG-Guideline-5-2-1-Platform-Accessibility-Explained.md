# **WCAG Guideline 5.2.1: Platform Accessibility Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

---

## **Guideline 5: Emerging Technologies**

The Emerging Technologies principle ensures that new and evolving web technologies are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## **Guideline 5.2: Platform Accessibility**

Guideline 5.2 focuses on making sure that the platforms themselves (not just the content) are accessible.

## **What Is Guideline 5.2.1 Platform Accessibility?**

[Illustration: Platform interface with accessibility icons and users]

> "Platforms must provide mechanisms for content to be accessible, including support for assistive technologies and accessibility APIs."

Guideline 5.2.1 requires that platforms (such as AR/VR systems, IoT hubs, or new web frameworks) provide the necessary hooks and APIs for content to be accessible.

- Ensures platforms support assistive technologies
- Applies to AR/VR, IoT, and new web platforms
- Makes accessibility possible for all content on the platform

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Platform icon, accessibility API, and user with assistive tech]

- **All Users:** Need accessible platforms to access content
- **Developers:** Rely on platform support for accessibility features
- **Accessibility:** Enables inclusive experiences on new technologies

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on Platform Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).

## **How to Meet Guideline 5.2.1**

[Side-by-side: Good example (platform with accessibility API) vs. Bad example (platform with no accessibility support)]

- Provide accessibility APIs and support for assistive technologies
- Document accessibility features for developers
- Test platform accessibility with real users

For more, see the [W3C's Platform Accessibility Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).
