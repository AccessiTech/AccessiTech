# **WCAG Guideline 4.1.1: Parsing Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

## **Guideline 4: Robust**

The Robust principle ensures that web content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## **Guideline 4.1: Compatible**

Guideline 4.1 focuses on making sure content can be reliably interpreted by a wide range of technologies.

## **What Is Guideline 4.1.1 Parsing?**

[Illustration: HTML code with a checkmark and accessibility icons]

> "In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique."

Guideline 4.1.1 requires that your code is well-formed and free of errors that could confuse browsers or assistive technologies.

- Ensures content is interpreted correctly by all user agents
- Essential for accessibility and future compatibility
- Applies to all markup languages (HTML, SVG, etc.)

## **Why Does It Matter?**

- **All Users:** Benefit from content that displays and works as intended
- **Assistive Technology Users:** Rely on well-formed code for accurate interpretation
- **Accessibility:** Reduces errors and increases reliability

## **What Needs to Be Well-Formed?**

[Grid: HTML, SVG, and other markup code]

- All HTML, SVG, and XML code
- Templates and components
- Any markup used in your site or app

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 4.1.1**

[Side-by-side: Good example (valid HTML) vs. Bad example (broken tags, duplicate IDs)]

- Use complete start and end tags
- Nest elements according to specifications
- Avoid duplicate attributes and IDs
- Validate code with automated tools (e.g., W3C Validator)

For more, see the [W3C's Parsing Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H88).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with valid code, right side with broken or invalid code]

- Missing or mismatched tags
- Duplicate attributes or IDs
- Incorrectly nested elements
- Not validating code before publishing

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 4.1.1 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level A:** Requires well-formed, valid markup.
- **Level AA:** No additional requirements for 4.1.1.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 4.1.1.

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 4.1.1 Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/parsing.html).

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Icons for code validation, tags, and IDs]

- All markup is well-formed and valid
- No duplicate attributes or IDs
- Elements are properly nested
- Code validated with automated tools
