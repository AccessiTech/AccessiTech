## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes providing more than one way to locate content on your site.

## **Guideline 2.4: Navigable**

Guideline 2.4 focuses on making it easier for users to navigate, find content, and determine where they are. Multiple Ways is about offering alternative navigation options.

> "More than one way is available to locate a web page within a set of web pages, except where the page is the result of, or a step in, a process."

Guideline 2.4.5 Multiple Ways is a Level AA requirement in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#multiple-ways).

- Users must have at least two ways to find each page (e.g., navigation menu, search, sitemap, table of contents).
- Exception: pages that are steps in a process (e.g., checkout, forms).
