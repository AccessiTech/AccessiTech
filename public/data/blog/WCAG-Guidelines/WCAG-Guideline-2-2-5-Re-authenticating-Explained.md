## **Guideline 2: Operable**

The Operable principle ensures that all users can interact with and control web content, regardless of their abilities. This includes letting users continue their work after re-authenticating, such as after a session timeout.

## **Guideline 2.2: Enough Time**

Guideline 2.2 focuses on making sure users have enough time and flexibility to complete tasks. Re-authenticating ensures users don’t lose their work if they need to log in again.
