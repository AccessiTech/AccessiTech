# **WCAG Guideline 3.2.4: Consistent Identification Explained**

**Estimated read time:** 5–6 minutes

## **Guideline 3: Understandable**

The Understandable principle ensures that web content is clear and predictable, including how controls and components are identified.

## **Guideline 3.2: Predictable**

Guideline 3.2 focuses on making web pages behave in ways users expect, especially regarding controls and repeated elements.

## **What Is Guideline 3.2.4 Consistent Identification?**

[Illustration: Website with repeated icons and buttons labeled the same way on every page]

> "Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently."

Guideline 3.2.4 requires that controls, icons, and components that perform the same function are labeled and identified the same way across your site.

- Helps users learn and recognize controls
- Essential for users with cognitive and visual disabilities
- Applies to all repeated controls, icons, and components

## **Why Does It Matter?**

[Infographic: Repeated button, icon, and user with cognitive accessibility icon]

- **Cognitive Disabilities:** Consistency reduces confusion and cognitive load
- **Screen Reader Users:** Predictable labels aid navigation
- **All Users:** Familiarity improves usability and trust

For more, see [W3C’s guidance on Consistent Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-identification.html).

---

## **What Needs to Be Consistently Identified?**

[Grid: Buttons, icons, links, and form controls]

- Buttons with the same function (e.g., "Submit", "Search")
- Icons representing the same action (e.g., print, download)
- Links to the same destination
- Form controls with the same purpose

---

## **How to Meet Guideline 3.2.4**

[Side-by-side: Good example (same label and icon for same function) vs. Bad example (different labels/icons for same function)]

- Use the same text, icon, and label for controls with the same function
- Avoid using different labels or icons for the same action
- Test your site for consistent identification of controls
- Use templates or components for repeated controls

For more, see the [W3C's Consistent Identification Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G197).

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

[Do/Don't graphic: Left side with consistent button labels, right side with different labels for same function]

- Using different labels or icons for the same function
- Changing the identification of controls between pages
- Not using templates or shared components for controls

---

## **Differences Between A, AA, and AAA for Guideline 3.2.4 in WCAG 2.2**

[Infographic: Three columns labeled A, AA, AAA with example requirements for each]

- **Level AA:** Requires consistent identification of controls and components.
- **Level AAA:** No additional requirements for 3.2.4.
- **Level A:** Not applicable (3.2.4 is a Level AA requirement).

For more, see the [W3C’s official documentation for 3.2.4 Consistent Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-identification.html).

---

## **Quick Checklist**

[Checklist graphic: Icons for button, label, and template]

- Controls with the same function have the same label and icon
- Repeated components are identified consistently across the site
- Templates or components are used for controls
- Tested for consistency with assistive technology
